Design History

	???


Game Overview

	Philosophy

		Philosophical point -1

			This game is trying to do this and that.  Fundamentally I am trying to achieve something that has never been achieved before.  Or.  This game will not try and change the world.  We are ripping off the competition so exactly that I can?t believe it.  The world will be shocked at how we are using an existing engine with new art.

		Philosophical point -2

			Our game only runs on Compaq computers.  The reason for this is such and such.  We believe the world is coming to and end anyhow so what difference does it make?

		Philosophical point -3

			When you create some of these overarching philosophical points about your design, say whatever you want.  Also, feel free to change it to ?My game design goals? or whatever you like to call it.

	Common Questions

		What is the game?

			Describe the game is a paragraph.  This is the answer to the most common question that you will be asked.  What are you working on?

Why create this game?

	Why are you creating this game?  Do you love 3D shooters?  Do you think there is a hole in the market for Jell-O tossing midgets?

Where does the game take place?

	Describe the world that your game takes place in.  Simple as that.  Help frame it in the reader?s mind by spending a few sentences on it here.  You can go into lengthy detail later in a section solely dedicated to describing the world.  Remember that we want to keep this part of the design light and readable.

What do I control?

	Describe what the player will control.  You will be in charge of a band of rabid mutant fiddle players.  If you want you can switch on the AI and turn it into a fish bowl simulation.

How many characters do I control?

	If this applies talk a little more about the control choices.  Remember to add answers to questions that you think the reader will ask.  This is totally dependent on your design.




What is the main focus?

	Now that we know where the game takes place and what the player controls.  What are they supposed to achieve in this world?  Angry fiddle players take over the U.N. building.  Be careful not to add a bunch of salesmanship here.  Your design wants to stay light and informative.

What?s different?

Tell them what is different from the games that are attempting this in the market right now.  This question comes up a lot.

World Feature -2

	Same thing here.  Don?t sell too hard.  These features should be awesome and be selling the game on its own.

 ?XYZ Appendix?

	Provide a brief description of what this appendix is for and then get down to business and provide data to the reader.

	Here are a few examples of some of the appendices in my latest design?

 ?Objects Appendix?

?User Interface Appendix?

 ?Networking Appendix?

?Character Rendering and Animation Appendix?

 ?Story Appendix?

	Okay, that?s it.  I wanted to spend more time on this and really make it a great roadmap for putting a game design together.  Unfortunately it would take a ton of time and that is something that we don?t have enough of in this business.  I think you get the idea anyhow.  Also, don?t get the impression that I think a design should provide the information in any particular order, this just happened to be the way it fell out of my head when I sat down.  Change this template any way you want and if you feel you have improved on it, send it back to me and I can pass it out as an alternative to anyone that asks me in the future.
