This prototype application uses the Paging Landscape Scene Manager 2 Plugin

Geomipmapping paging landscape scene manager with real time deformation


The Paging Scene Manager allows scenes to be split into a set of pages.
Only those pages that are being used need be loaded at any given time, allowing arbitrarily large scenes.
Each page has its own heightmap, to which several textures can be applied by height.
(This allows snowy-peaked mountains within a green landscape, for example.)
